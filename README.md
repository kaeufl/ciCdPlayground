# The playground

This is intended to be a minimal project for a CI/CD workshop.
It consists of a simple JavaScript project, some unit and integration tests, and example configuration for some CI/CD tools.

## Setup

Yarn is recommended, but corresponding npm commands should work, too.

To install dependencies run `yarn`

Serve at localhost:8081 with `yarn dev`

Run tests with `yarn test` and `yarn test:e2e`

**NOTES**:

- For participants:
  Pease check the preparation notes in Confluence. That's all you need to know, but of course you are welcome to look around.
- For organisers:
  There is some more info in `organiser_notes.md`.
